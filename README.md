## Dual Averaging Method for online graph-structured sparsity

## Overview

Welcome to the repository of GraphDA! This repository is only for 
reproducing all experimental results shown in our KDD paper. To 
install it via pip, please try [sparse-learn](https://github.com/baojianzhou/sparse-learn). 
More details of GraphDA can be found in: "Zhou, Baojian, Feng Chen, and Yiming Ying. "Dual Averaging Method for Online Graph-structured Sparsity." arXiv preprint arXiv:1905.10714 (2019).".

## Preparation
Our code is based on [Openblas-0.3.1](https://github.com/xianyi/OpenBLAS/releases/tag/v0.3.1), which we already copied into our repository. You can first goto OpenBLAS-0.3.1 folder and then make install it via the following command:
```sh
cd OpenBLAS-0.3.1
make && make install
```
